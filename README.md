# Introduction
This repository hosts the production and developmental code for **NOVALASTIX.COM**, a real website for a fictional organization. I created this to practice my front-end and back-end web development skills as well as flesh out my creative ideas for various unrelated world-building projects. **NOVALASTIX.COM** is designed to be a modern, responsive, and user friendly website for me to show off various web projects I'm working on as well as anything else I find interesting.

# Current Features
I am still in the process of building the bones of this website, so all I have to show for now is a very responsive navigation bar that leads to nowhere and a page that shows off basic formatting!

# Planned Features
* **MARKET** - A bunch of Google Charts displaying data from a fictional Stock Market API
* **ARCHIVE** - A filebrowser for viewing and downloading whatever I feel like hosting
* **CONSOLE** - An interactive command terminal!
* **ACCOUNT** - The ability to create and log into user accounts.

# Technical Stack
## Frontend
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
## Backend
* PHP
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
* MySQL
## Hosting
The production site for **NOVALASTIX.COM** is hosted on [DeamHost](http://dreamhost.com/)
